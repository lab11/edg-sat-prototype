module EDG.Classes.SATBuilder where

-- | This module has the t(somewhat abstract) class that we can use to
--   describe an EDG problem, and then an implementation of that class
--   would also have functions to turn that into a SAT problem or whatever.

-- TODO :: On second thought, this can wait till a first concrete version of
--         a builder monad. Once we have that we can just generalize later.
